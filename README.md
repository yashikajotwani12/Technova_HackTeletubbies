# Inspiration


- Only 15% of bitcoin traders are women, highlighting a massive gender imbalance in the world of cryptocurrency, according to new data from eToro.
- In the world of cryptocurrency, women are shockingly underrepresented, even compared to the overwhelmingly male tech sector as a whole.
- Four-in-five (81%) have never purchased cryptocurrency
- In fact, only one-in-ten (10%) said they fully understand how cryptocurrencies work
- A third (35%) believe cryptocurrencies are a fraud
- Almost every sixth (14%), though, of those that are not using cryptocurrency currently would like to in the future
- Nearly a fifth (19%) that use cryptocurrencies have experienced hacking attacks on exchanges and (15%) have been victims of cryptocurrency fraud. 

Our inspiration grew from focusing on women empowerment when it comes to having independence towards their own finances. As women, we wanted to create something we all were interested in and that was cryptocurrency, investing and finance. Understanding that there is a massive gender imbalance in the world of cryptocurrency, we wanted to alter this and allow women to dive deep into the world of finance.
